themes.</p><h2 id=improve-end-users-confidence>Improve end users confidence</h2><p>We want our users to feel confident about using Kubewarden, knowing that good
development and security practices are being followed by the Kubewarden project.
We think this is particularly relevant to Kubewarden, given our users trust us
to keep their Kubernetes clusters secure and compliant.</p><p>To achieve that, we&rsquo;ve joined the <a href=https://clomonitor.io/>CLOMonitor</a> initiative.
This is a project from the Clound Native Foundation which performs a series of
checks to ensure certain project health best practices are met.</p><p>We are proud to announce that Kubewarden is currently A-rated, with a score above
the 90%. The results are completely transparent and can be found by visiting
the <a href=https://clomonitor.io/projects/cncf/kubewarden>Kubewarden dashboard</a>
on the CLOMonitor website.</p><h2 id=performance-improvements>Performance improvements</h2><p>We have reduced the startup time of Policy Server, the component in charge of
running all our WebAssembly policies.
Now, starting a Policy Server with multiple policies defined is an order of
magnitude faster.</p><h2 id=better-sigstore-integration>Better Sigstore integration</h2><p><a href=https://sigstore.dev>Sigstore</a> is a project that is changing the way software
can be safely distributed.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve seen the potential of Sigstore and we&rsquo;ve embraced the project not just to
sign our own artifacts (binaries, container images and even policies), but also
to offer policies capable of
<a href=https://artifacthub.io/packages/kubewarden/verify-image-signatures/verify-image-signatures>verifying image signatures</a>.</p><p>Starting from the 1.3.0 release, Kubewarden can handle Sigstore signatures
produced using a PKCS11 token, like hardware security modules (HSM) and smart
cards.</p><p>This has been made possible by the work done by members of the Kubewarden team
inside of the official <a href=https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-rs>Sigstore SDK for Rust</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Info:</strong> given all the Sigstore verification code happens on the host side,
not inside of WebAssembly module, there&rsquo;s no need to update the
<a href=https://artifacthub.io/packages/kubewarden/verify-image-signatures/verify-image-signatures>Verify Image Signatures</a>
policy to gain this functionality.</p></blockquote><p>Talking about Sigstore integration, we&rsquo;ve been proud consumers and
ambassadors of the keyless signing mechanism. We believe this functionality
provides a secure way to sign and verify artifacts, even inside of CI/CD
pipelines, without the hassle of maintaining a public key infrastructure.</p><p>We&rsquo;re happy to learn that keyless signing is now considered stable by
Sigstore community after the
recent announcement of <a href=https://blog.sigstore.dev/sigstore-ga-ddd6ba67894d>Rekor and Fulcio being General Available</a>.</p><h2 id=policy-improvements>Policy improvements</h2><p>We have recently created some new Kubewarden policies. All of them are
already available on <a href=https://artifacthub.io>ArtifactHub</a>.</p><p>So far we&rsquo;ve published a <a href=/blog/2022/10/env-var-secrets/>blog post</a>
dedicated to the
<a href=https://artifacthub.io/packages/kubewarden/env-variable-secrets-scanner/env-variable-secrets-scanner>environment variable secret scanner</a>
policy.
In next weeks we will publish other posts dedicated to the
<a href=https://artifacthub.io/packages/kubewarden/volumemounts-policy/volumemounts>volumeMounts</a>
and to the
<a href=https://artifacthub.io/packages/kubewarden/environment-variable-policy/environment-variable-policy>environment variable compliance</a>
policies.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve also updated some of the existing policies that used to target only <code>Pod</code>
resources. These policies have been extended to be able to analyze also
other higher level Kubernetes resources like <code>Deployment</code>, <code>ReplicaSet</code>,
<code>DaemonSet</code>, <code>ReplicationController</code>, <code>Job</code> and <code>CronJob</code>.</p><p>This allows the Kubernetes administrators to decide at which level the policy
is going to operate:</p><ul><li>Target Pod: different kind of resources (be them native or CRDs) can create Pod
objects. By having the policy target Pods, we guarantee that all the Pods are going
to be compliant, even those created by CRDs.
However, this could lead to confusion among users of the cluster,
as high level Kubernetes resources would be successfully created, but would
stay in a non reconciled state.
For example: a Deployment defining a non compliant Pod would be accepted
into the cluster, but it would never have all its replicas running because
the policy would prevent the creation of its Pods.</li><li>Target higher level resources (e.g: Deployment): users of the cluster
will get immediate feedback about rejections. However, non compliant pods
created by other higher level resources (be it native to Kubernetes,
or CRDs), would not get rejected. For example, a Policy targeting only
Deployment objects would not prevent the creation of non compliant Pods
spawned by a DaemonSet.</li></ul><p>There&rsquo;s no right or wrong approach, it&rsquo;s even possible to use both of them
at the same time (target Pods plus some higher level resource). What
matters is that Kubernetes administrators have full control of this detail.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s next</h2><p>We&rsquo;re already actively working on what is going to become our next release.</p><p>In the meantime, try out the freshly backed 1.3.0 release and feel free
