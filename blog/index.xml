We have some Easter eggs for you in this one.
Promoting our policies to v1.0.0 In the past, we consciously picked semver 0.X.Y for policy versions as that meant that the policy API for the user (in this case, the policy spec.settings) was not considered stable.
Since the settings of our policies haven&amp;rsquo;t changed since their initial release, we decided it was time to highlight their stability by promoting them to v1.</description></item><item><title>Rego policy library relaunch</title><link>/blog/2025/04/rego-policy-library-relaunch/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2025/04/rego-policy-library-relaunch/</guid><description>We are excited to announce the latest additions to our policy library!
Seventy finely crafted Rego policies are now available for you to use in your Kubernetes clusters.

The issue The issue allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the Pod running the controller. The attacker can then steal the Kubernetes identity of the nginx-ingress controller which, by design, has access to all the Secrets defined in the cluster.
The issue is exploited by making http requests against the validating webhook server used by the nginx-ingress controller.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden at KubeCon EU 2025</title><link>/blog/2025/03/kubecon-eu-2025/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2025/03/kubecon-eu-2025/</guid><description>For those attending KubeCon EU 2025 in London, we’re excited to announce that some of our team will be there!

This release includes a fix for a bug that, under certain circumstances, could prevent users from pushing policies to a container registry.
The 1.22.0 release introduces the ability to add policy annotations to the manifest of the OCI artifact that is pushed to the container registry. This feature is useful for adding metadata to the OCI artifact that can be utilized by other tools in the CI/CD pipeline.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.22 release</title><link>/blog/2025/02/kubewarden-1.22-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2025/02/kubewarden-1.22-release/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce the release of Kubewarden v1.22! This release brings some improvements to kwctl and the Rust SDK, together with some internal changes to prepare for future work.
Breaking change: PolicyServer health check endpoint change ⚠️ IMPORTANT⚠️ Breaking change: If you have created a custom instance of PolicyServer with a hard-coded .spec.image, you must update it to consume the v1.22.0 tag.
Starting from 1.22, the Policy Server health check endpoint is exposed on port 80 instead of port 443, and Policy Server Deployment objects created by the kubewarden-controller make this assumption.</description></item><item><title>Beyond Prefix Matching</title><link>/blog/2025/02/beyond-prefix-matching/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2025/02/beyond-prefix-matching/</guid><description>A recent Aqua Security blog post highlighted the risks of misconfigured Kubernetes policy engines, particularly when dealing with OPA Gatekeeper. The post correctly points out the challenges of managing complex policies and the potential for bypasses due to misconfigurations. However, it also underscores a critical limitation of many policy engines: their reliance on string manipulation, especially when dealing with OCI image references. This is where Kubewarden takes a different, and significantly more robust, approach.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.21.1 patch release</title><link>/blog/2025/02/kubewarden-1-21-1-patch-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2025/02/kubewarden-1-21-1-patch-release/</guid><description>Today we published the 1.21.1 patch releases of the kwctl and Policy Server components of the Kubewarden stack.
The release ensures all Sigstore verification capabilities work.
What happened On Monday, February 3rd, the contents of Sigstore&amp;rsquo;s TUF repository were updated. During this process, part of the repository metadata wasn&amp;rsquo;t properly handled. Specifically, one of the KEYIDs of the repository wasn&amp;rsquo;t updated when the key contents were modified.
The breaking change wasn&amp;rsquo;t noticed by upstream maintainers as the TUF Go implementation is not performing strict verification of the KEYID.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.21 release</title><link>/blog/2025/01/kubewarden-1-21-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2025/01/kubewarden-1-21-release/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce the release of Kubewarden v1.21, our first release of 2025!
The release addresses two security issues that the Kubewarden team has discovered. Detailed information about them is included below. While these issues do not have a critical impact, we recommend our users upgrade their Kubewarden deployments.
Alongside these security fixes, the 1.21 release includes the usual stream of dependency updates and features some improvements to our documentation.</description></item><item><title>The Year in Review: Kubewarden's Progress in 2024</title><link>/blog/2024/12/end-year-2024/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/12/end-year-2024/</guid><description>It was an exciting year for Kubewarden policy management.

AdmissionPolicyGroups: Namespaced policy comprised of several policies. ClusterAdmissionPolicyGroups: Clusterwide policy comprised of several policies. These new Policy Groups resources define a policy comprised of several policies and their policy settings, and they perform a combined evaluation of those multiple policies using logical operators.
Why are these useful? Because they reuse existing policies, reducing the need for custom policy creation.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.17 release</title><link>/blog/2024/10/kubewarden-1-17-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/10/kubewarden-1-17-release/</guid><description>We are thrilled to announce the release of Kubewarden v1.17.0. This release is packed with big features, let&amp;rsquo;s have a look!
Certificate rotation &amp;amp; removal of cert-manager dependency Starting from this release, the Kubewarden stack takes care of creating and rotating all the needed TLS certificates and certificate authorities.
Kubewarden, by virtue of connecting to the Kubernetes API server, needs TLS certificates for both the kubewarden-controller (when creating webhooks for its policies) and for the PolicyServers (so they can report their results to the Webhook API server).</description></item><item><title>Policy Server and kwctl 1.16.1 patch releases</title><link>/blog/2024/09/policy-server-and-kwctl-1-16-1-patch-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/09/policy-server-and-kwctl-1-16-1-patch-release/</guid><description>Policy Server and kwctl 1.16.1 patch releases Today we published the 1.16.1 patch release of Policy Server and kwctl.
The release addresses a breaking change inside Sigstore&amp;rsquo;s TUF repository. The change caused errors while retrieving the contents of the TUF repository, which broke part of Kubewarden&amp;rsquo;s integration with Sigstore.
More specifically, it was no longer possible to verify the signatures of Kubewarden&amp;rsquo;s policies and to verify the signatures of the container images used inside of a Kubernetes cluster via policies like verify-image-signatures.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.16 release</title><link>/blog/2024/08/kubewarden-1-16-release/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/08/kubewarden-1-16-release/</guid><description>Kubewarden v1.16.0 release We are thrilled to announce the release of Kubewarden v1.16.0! Following the northern hemisphere summer, this version packs some goodies but is a bit more lightweight than usual.
kwctl scaffold for AdmissionRequests The kwctl cli has learned a new command, kwctl scaffold admission-request, which prints a Kubernetes AdmissionRequest object from the provided Kubernetes resource definition.

This version comes packed with new capabilities, enhancements, and fixes that make Kubewarden even more robust and user-friendly.
New Host Capability for Container Image Configuration One of the significant updates in this release is the introduction of a new host capability that allows policies to fetch the container image configuration. This update stems from a user request to enhance the user-group-psp-policy policy by enabling it to check the user defined to run the container in the image configuration.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the CEL policy</title><link>/blog/2024/06/welcome-cel-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/06/welcome-cel-policy/</guid><description>We are pleased to announce a new policy by the Kubewarden team: cel-policy.
This new policy uses the Common Expression Language (CEL). For those new to CEL, it is a general-purpose expression language designed to be fast, portable, and safe to execute. CEL as a language is memory-safe, side-effect free, terminating (as in &amp;ldquo;programs cannot loop forever&amp;rdquo;), and strong &amp;amp; dynamically typed.
CEL is a perfect candidate for extending the Kubernetes API, as CEL expressions can be easily inlined into CRD schemas, and compiled and type-checked &amp;ldquo;ahead-of-time&amp;rdquo; (when CRDs are created and updated).</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.13 release</title><link>/blog/2024/06/kubewarden-1-13-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/06/kubewarden-1-13-release/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to announce a new release of Kubewarden, version 1.13. This release features a series of improvements and bug fixes that contribute to better performance and stability.
Let&amp;rsquo;s go through the most significant changes.
Policy Server memory usage A community member reported that the Kubewarden Policy Server was using a lot of memory, especially when running context aware policies on big clusters. The number of resources being accessed by the policies was significantly high, in the order of 3200 Namespaces, 10500 Ingresses, 200 ClusterRoleBindings and 11000 RoleBindings.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.12 release</title><link>/blog/2024/04/kubewarden-1-12-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/04/kubewarden-1-12-release/</guid><description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re glad to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.12.
This release focuses on optimizations and high availability, both oriented to production.
Optimizing Gatekeeper policies The previous 1.11 release featured lots of optimizations for context aware policies.
The 1.12 release provides a further optimization for Gatekeeper policies that access Kubernetes resources. This optimization provides an extra 55% performance boost for these policies.
The benefits of this optimization are particularly noticeable when a huge number of Kubernetes resources are accessed by a Gatekeeper policy.</description></item><item><title>Introducing Kubewarden's Community Repository</title><link>/blog/2024/04/community-repository/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/04/community-repository/</guid><description>The Kubewarden project has recently improved how it shares information and involves others by starting a new community repository. This move was made after a suggestion from the CNCF during their last yearly review. The aim is to bring together all the documentation in one place and make it easier for both new and current contributors to get involved.

This function, supported in both Rust and Go SDKs, enhances the policy enforcement capabilities within Kubernetes environments.
The update provides an additional layer of security inspection for containerized environments. Developers can now write policies using the updated SDKs to access OCI image manifests of container images. This access facilitates more detailed inspections and validations, aligning with security standards and organizational protocols.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.11 release</title><link>/blog/2024/03/kubewarden-1-11-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/03/kubewarden-1-11-release/</guid><description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re glad to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.11.
This release focuses on performance improvements, especially when running on big Kubernetes clusters.
Audit Scanner A lot of work has been done on the audit scanner. The auditing of resources is now done in parallel, which means less time is required on big clusters to scan all the available resources.
We&amp;rsquo;ve also changed how we handle Policy Reports. Kubewarden is still using the Policy Report format being defined inside the Kubernetes&amp;rsquo;s wg-policy group.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.10 release</title><link>/blog/2024/01/kubewarden-1-10-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/01/kubewarden-1-10-release/</guid><description>We have the first release of 2024, Kubewarden 1.10.0! 🎉🥳
And this one contains a nice bag of goodies, let&amp;rsquo;s have a look!
Reduced memory usage and increased reliability of Policy servers A nice graph is worth a thousand words!
Note the slightly lower memory consumption, and unchanging consumption when scaling horizontally.
This graph represents the memory consumption of one instance of policy-server, containing 13 policies:
4 instances of &amp;ldquo;verify-signatures&amp;rdquo; 5 of &amp;ldquo;pod-privileged&amp;rdquo; 2 of &amp;ldquo;go-wasi-template&amp;rdquo; (a 20MB policy, WASI being experimental) 1 Rego policy 1 ordinary Rust policy The policy-server was configured with one worker to start, progressing to eight.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 2023 Wrapped</title><link>/blog/2023/12/kubewarden-2023-wrapped/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/12/kubewarden-2023-wrapped/</guid><description>The end of the year is around the corner. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at what the Kubewarden project achieved in 2023!
Context-Aware graduation The context-aware feature graduated to stable during this year. We did this by performing a massive overhaul of the initial iteration. Context-aware policies can access information about Kubernetes resources defined inside the cluster. At evaluation time, these policies can make decisions based on this information. Such an example is the unique ingress host policy.</description></item><item><title>Raw policies</title><link>/blog/2023/11/raw-policies/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/11/raw-policies/</guid><description>Kubewarden 1.9.0 has introduced even more features requested by the community, and we are excited to share them with you!
In this blog post, we will introduce the new Raw policy type.
Kubewarden as a generic policy engine Raw policies allow policy authors to write and execute policies that are not necessarily related to Kubernetes. This means that Kubewarden can be used as a general-purpose policy engine. For instance, you can use Kubewarden to validate any type of artifact: configurations, Terraform plans, test coverage, static analysis or even deploy Kubewarden alongside your web application to validate domain-specific requests.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.9.0 release</title><link>/blog/2023/11/kubewarden-1.9-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/11/kubewarden-1.9-release/</guid><description>Not even a month after the 1.8.0 release, today we are happy to announce Kubewarden 1.9.0! 🎉🥳
This release includes two major features that have been requested by our community.
Making Rego policies context-aware Context-aware policies have been introduced with Kubewarden 1.6.0. These policies can obtain information about other Kubernetes resources at evaluation time.

It is required that the programming language can generate the necessary WebAssembly module for use by Kubewarden.
When using a traditional programming language, the communication between the host executing the policy and the WebAssembly guest (the actual policy) uses the waPC communication protocol. This protocol provides a bidirectional channel between the host and guest.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.8.0 release</title><link>/blog/2023/10/kubewarden-1.8-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/10/kubewarden-1.8-release/</guid><description>Today we are happy to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.8.0! 🎉🥳
This is a small release, focused on OpenTelemetry.
The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) got its first 1.0.0 version in July 2023; several libraries got their first 1.0.0 release, such as the Go metric SDK or the .NET Automatic Instrumentation.
Still, the OpenTelemetry stack is not yet stable, and unannounced backwards-incompatible changes still happen.

Audit Scanner? Up until the release of Audit Scanner, Kubewarden was strictly a Dynamic Admission Controller, checking requests made against the Kubernetes API server with the deployed policies.
Yet policies evolve over time; new ones are deployed, and existing ones are updated. This can mean that resources that are inside the cluster are no longer compliant.</description></item><item><title>kwctl SHA support</title><link>/blog/2023/09/kwctl-sha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/09/kwctl-sha/</guid><description>Recently, we have focused on improving the Kubewarden developer experience. We have been implementing features requested by the community.
Reference policies by their SHA Since kwctl release v1.7.0 we support referencing policies by their SHA.
Container engines such as Docker and Podman allow users to refer to images by their SHA sum.
As Kubewarden policies are distributed as OCI artifacts, we thought it would be a good idea to add the SHA support to kwctl, so that users have a familiar experience.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.7.0 release</title><link>/blog/2023/09/kubewarden-1.7-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/09/kubewarden-1.7-release/</guid><description>Today we are delighted to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.7.0! 🎊 🥳 Aside from the bug and stability fixes, this release is packed with new features.

This version brings some minor fixes to our controller and helm charts and two new interesting features.
Sigstore certificate verification Kubewarden integration with Sigstore keeps growing. Starting from this release it&amp;rsquo;s possible to verify signatures that have been produced with certificates.
This can be useful to organizations that are using hardware tokens and KMS solutions to sign their container images via Sigstore.</description></item><item><title>Support for sigstore certificate signing</title><link>/blog/2022/12/sigstore-certificate-verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/12/sigstore-certificate-verification/</guid><description>Secure supply chain is one of the hottest topics right now. Many organizations are implementing strategies to verify the provenance of their software starting from the development phase up to the deployment in production.
Sigstore is an open source project that makes incredibly easy to sign and verify assets. Lots of open source projects and organizations are using it to sign and verify their container images, system packages and any kind of binary artifact.</description></item><item><title>Installing and Running Kubewarden In Air-Gapped Environments</title><link>/blog/2022/11/airgap/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/11/airgap/</guid><description>We are glad to announce that deploying Kubewarden in air gap environments has been simplified and documented! For that, you will need a private OCI registry accessible by your Kubernetes cluster. Kubewarden policies are WebAssembly modules; therefore they can be stored inside an OCI-compliant registry as OCI artifacts. For an air gap installation you need to download all the Kubewarden container images and policies in your workstation, then move them to your private OCI registry.</description></item><item><title>Keeping track of Kubernetes deprecated resources</title><link>/blog/2022/11/deprecation-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/11/deprecation-policy/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s fact of life: as the Kubernetes API evolves, it&amp;rsquo;s periodically reorganized or upgraded. This means some Kubernetes resources can be deprecated and later removed.
We deserve to easily keep track of those deprecations and removals. For that, we have just released the deprecated-api-versions policy.
A look at the deprecated-api-versions policy This policy detects the usage of Kubernetes resources that have been deprecated or removed from the Kubernetes API.
The policy has two settings:</description></item><item><title>Securing the usage of volumeMounts</title><link>/blog/2022/11/volumemounts-policy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/11/volumemounts-policy/</guid><description>We present to you the new volumeMounts Policy: It inspects containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers, and restricts their usage of volumes by checking the volume name being used in the containers' volumeMounts[*].name.
You can find it published in Artifact Hub. As usual, its artifact is signed with Sigstore in keyless mode, and if you are curious, you can peek into the policy&amp;rsquo;s implementation in Rust here.
This new policy joins the already existing volumes-psp policy, which provides an allowlist of volume types, and hostpaths-psp policy, with an allowlist of hostPath volumes.</description></item><item><title>Enforcing compliance of container's environment variables</title><link>/blog/2022/10/envvar-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/envvar-policy/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re glad to present the new environment-variable-policy to Kubewarden users. With this policy, you will now be able to inspect init containers and ephemeral containers. You can also restrict their usage by reviewing the names and values defined under the containers' env[*] field.
As always, the policy can be found in ArtifactHub and all the artifacts, including the BOM files, are signed with Sigstore.
What is so useful about the new environment-variable policy?</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.3 is out!</title><link>/blog/2022/10/kubewarden_1_3_release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/kubewarden_1_3_release/</guid><description>The Kubewarden development team is happy to announce the release of the Kubewarden 1.3 stack.
In addition to the usual amount of small fixes, this release focused on the following themes.
Improve end users confidence We want our users to feel confident about using Kubewarden, knowing that good development and security practices are being followed by the Kubewarden project. We think this is particularly relevant to Kubewarden, given our users trust us to keep their Kubernetes clusters secure and compliant.</description></item><item><title>Scanning secrets in environment variables</title><link>/blog/2022/10/env-var-secrets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/env-var-secrets/</guid><description>We are thrilled to announce you can now scan your environment variables for secrets with the new env-variable-secrets-scanner-policy! This policy rejects a Pod or workload resources such as Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets , ReplicationControllers, Jobs, CronJobs etc. if a secret is found in the environment variable within a container, init container, or ephemeral container. Secrets that are leaked in plain text or in base64 encoded variables are detected.
This policy uses rusty hog, an open source secret scanner from New Relic.</description></item><item><title>v1.1.1 is out 🎉</title><link>/blog/2022/07/v1.1.1-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/07/v1.1.1-release/</guid><description>We are happy to announce the first minor release of v1.0: v1.1.1 is now available!
Apart from being a nice looking number, v1.1.1 includes:
Improved the policies API for Sigstore verification by adding new backwards-compatible WaPC host callback v2/verify functions to the API. Check them out here to add support for your language of choice.
This has been used in the verify-image-signatures policy to simplify verification of GitHub Actions signatures and others.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden policies, now on Artifact Hub!</title><link>/blog/2022/07/artifact-hub-supports-kubewarden/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/07/artifact-hub-supports-kubewarden/</guid><description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re happy to announce that Artifact Hub now supports Kubewarden policies! 🤯 🥳
Artifact Hub is the de-facto place where Cloud Native users search for helm charts, container images, and other kinds of artifacts and configurations of different CNCF projects. That&amp;rsquo;s why we are super excited and honored to have Kubewarden policies listed on Artifact Hub.
This would not have been possible without the work done by the Artifact Hub team.</description></item><item><title>Verify image signatures with GitHub Actions and KeylessPrefix</title><link>/blog/2022/07/verify-signatures-with-gha-and-prefix/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/07/verify-signatures-with-gha-and-prefix/</guid><description>With the latest releases of Kubewarden v1.1.0 and the verify-image-signatures policy, it&amp;rsquo;s now possible to use GithubActions or KeylessPrefix for verifying images. Read our previous blog post if you want to learn more about how to verify container images with Sigstore using Kubewarden.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see it in action! We want to verify the image ghcr.io/raulcabello/app-example which was built and signed inside a GitHub action using this GitHub Action.
Out of the box, GitHub Actions have a specially crafted environment that makes Sigstore keyless signing work in a non-interactive way.</description></item><item><title>Migrate your PSPs to Kubewarden policies!</title><link>/blog/2022/07/psp-migration-script/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/07/psp-migration-script/</guid><description>Warning: the code snippets shown inside of this blog post have become outdated. For up-to-date information checkout this section of the Kubewarden documentation.
As announced in past blog posts, Kubewarden has 100% coverage of the deprecated, and soon to be removed, Kubernetes PSPs. If everything goes as expected the PSPs will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25 due for release on 23rd August 2022.
The Kubewarden team has written a script that leverages the migration tool written by AppVia, to migrate PSP automatically.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden reaches 1.0.0 release 🎉</title><link>/blog/2022/06/v1-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/06/v1-release/</guid><description>Kubewarden is a policy engine for Kubernetes that is part of CNCF Sandbox.
Never heard of Kubewarden before? Do you want to know what makes Kubewarden stand out among similar solutions? This is a high level overview of Kubewarden&amp;rsquo;s unique points:
Boost Policy Authors' productivity: write policies using your favorite programming language. Leverage your knowledge, skills and tools. Policies are portable WebAssembly modules Reuse your existing Open Policy Agent / Gatekeeper policies Distribute policies using regular container registries Secure supply chain, leverage Sigstore to sign and verify policies Today, a year and a half since its conception, we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to announce the release of Kubewarden v1.</description></item><item><title>CNCF Sandbox admission 🎊</title><link>/blog/2022/06/cncf-sandbox-inclusion/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/06/cncf-sandbox-inclusion/</guid><description>Today the whole Kubewarden team is overjoyed because the Kubewarden project has just been accepted into the CNCF Sandbox!!! 🥳
This is a great achievement for the whole team and is the beginning of our journey into CNCF. Also, many thanks to the CNCF TOC for the feedback they provided during the project evaluation.
What&amp;rsquo;s next? The admission happens at an interesting time since we are currently testing the 1.0.0-rc1 release of Kubewarden.</description></item><item><title>Secure Supply Chain: Verifying image signatures</title><link>/blog/2022/05/verifying-image-signatures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/05/verifying-image-signatures/</guid><description>After these last releases Kubewarden now has support for verifying the integrity and authenticity of artifacts within Kubewarden using the Sigstore project. In this post, we shall focus on verifying container image signatures using the new verify-image-signatures policy.
To learn more about how Sigstore works, take a look at our previous post
Verify Image Signatures Policy This policy validates Pods by checking their container images for signatures (that is, containers, init containers and ephemeral containers in the pod)</description></item><item><title>Have you migrated your Kubernetes PodSecurityPolicy?</title><link>/blog/2022/05/psp-migration-docs/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/05/psp-migration-docs/</guid><description>If you use a version of Kubernetes (&amp;lt; v1.24) that supports the deprecated PodSecurityPolicy (a.k.a PSP), you would be wondering what to do after the Kubernetes v1.25 version when the PSP will be removed. With this in mind, the Kuberwarden team wrote a documentation to help users migrate away from PSPs to Kuberwarden policies.
As you know, the original Pod Security Policies had many configuration knobs. The Kubewarden team created a series of policies that offer a 100% feature parity with all the soon to be dropped Pod Security Policies.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Monitor mode</title><link>/blog/2022/05/monitor-mode/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/05/monitor-mode/</guid><description>Policies are a core component of a Kubernetes cluster story that involves security, compliance and consistency.
Being this process an iterative one, it&amp;rsquo;s common for new policies to potentially reject operations that we might be issuing today in our production clusters.
As an example, we might have decided that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to change certain annotations on existing resources after the fact. In this case, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to revoke UPDATE rights completely, but just to define an inalterable set of annotations after the resource has been created.</description></item><item><title>Secure Supply Chain with Kubewarden: securing Kubewarden policies</title><link>/blog/2022/04/securing-kubewarden-policies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/04/securing-kubewarden-policies/</guid><description>With recent releases, the Kubewarden stack supports verifying the integrity and authenticity of content using the Sigstore project.
In this post, we focus on Kubewarden Policies and how to create a Secure Supply Chain for them.
Sigstore? Since a full Sigstore dive is not within the scope for this post, we recommend checking out their nice docs.
In short, Sigstore provides an automatable workflow to match the distributed Open Source development model.</description></item><item><title>CRI-O CVE-2022-0811 Mitigation</title><link>/blog/2022/03/cri-o-cve-mitigation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/03/cri-o-cve-mitigation/</guid><description>Recently a severe CVE in the CRI-O container engine come to public. The flaw in CRI-O allows bad actors to gain root access and run arbitrary code in the host machine.
A fix for the issue is already available and you should update your cluster to avoid any headache in the future. But if you cannot do that right away, use Kubewarden to mitigate the impact of this issue. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to prevent pods with sysctl configuration to run in the cluster with the policy sysctl-psp available in the Policy Hub.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the AdmissionPolicy</title><link>/blog/2022/03/admission-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/03/admission-policy/</guid><description>Up till now, the only way to define a policy in Kubewarden was to use the ClusterAdmissionPolicy resource that would be applied to cluster-wide resources across all namespaces.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to announce the new AdmissionPolicy resource. This new resource is created inside a namespace and the policies will only process the requests that are targeting the namespace where the AdmissionPolicy is defined. Except from being a &amp;ldquo;namespaced&amp;rdquo; resource, AdmissionPolicy works exactly the same as the ClusterAdmissionPolicy.</description></item><item><title>Multiplatform Kubewarden</title><link>/blog/2022/02/multiplatform-kubewarden/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/02/multiplatform-kubewarden/</guid><description>The Kubewarden team is glad to announce that in the spirit of helping Policy Authors and Cluster Administrators, the project is now officially multiplatform.
The list of supported platforms as of now are:
Policy Server, as a container image:
linux/amd64 (with the musl libc) linux/arm64 (with the musl libc) kwctl, as a standalone binary:
darwin (x86_64) linux (aarch64, with the musl libc) linux (x86_64, with the musl libc) windows (x86_64, with MSVC) We have prioritized the usage of the same dependencies and toolchain on platforms where we were able to do so.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden policies cover all the Kubernetes Pod Security Policies</title><link>/blog/2022/01/mutating-policy-behave-as-validating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/01/mutating-policy-behave-as-validating/</guid><description>The Kubewarden team worked tirelessly to create equivalent Kubewarden policies for all the deprecated Pod Security Policies (PSP). In order to reach this very important milestone, the team wrote the policies with the same validations available in the Kubernetes PSPs, and we counted on the community help to map and validate the policies.
This will allow our users to replace deprecated PSPs while continuing to enforce their security rules.
The Kubewarden policies which replace all the Kubernetes PSPs, are available in the Policy Hub, and you can find them by typing the keyword &amp;ldquo;PSP&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Policy Server on aarch64</title><link>/blog/2022/01/policy-server-on-aarch64/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/01/policy-server-on-aarch64/</guid><description>We recently got notified that the policy-server was crashing in an aarch64 environment. The moment in which it got a request from the API server, it crashed immediately with a SIGSEGV signal.
We figured out that this was only happening when the request was a TLS one, and that the problem was related to the OpenSSL stack and the way we were producing the final image of the policy-server with the OpenSSL stack.</description></item><item><title>First year of Kubewarden</title><link>/blog/2021/12/first-year-of-kubewarden/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/12/first-year-of-kubewarden/</guid><description>Year 2021 is almost over.

As such they often have the need to log information. In general, we are used to make our programs log into standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) outputs.
However, policies run in a confined WebAssembly environment. For this mechanism to work as usual Kubewarden would need to set up the runtime environment in a way that the policy can write to stdout and stderr file descriptors, and upon completion, Kubewarden can check them &amp;ndash; or stream log messages as they pop up.</description></item><item><title>A new architecture to ease Kubewarden administrators' lives</title><link>/blog/2021/10/new-architecture/new-architecture-to-ease-kubewarden-administrators-lives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/10/new-architecture/new-architecture-to-ease-kubewarden-administrators-lives/</guid><description>We are pleased to announce a new architecture for the Kubewarden stack, in line with its journey to maturity:

It can be used to secure your clusters and to ensure they stay compliant with the rules your organization establishes over time.
By leveraging the power of WebAssembly, Kubewarden allows policy authors to write policies using traditional programming languages such as Rust, Go, AssemblyScript and Swift.
Kubewarden policies, once compiled into WebAssembly modules, are then distributed using regular OCI registries. This allows Operators to have a consistent way to securely distribute both container images and policies.</description></item><item><title>WebAssembly is coming to Cloud Native</title><link>/blog/2021/07/webassembly-is-coming-to-cloud-native/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/07/webassembly-is-coming-to-cloud-native/</guid><description>Is the title of this post a pun inspired by Christmas or by the Games of Thrones?
