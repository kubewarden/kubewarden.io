We are happy to highlight a recent CNCF webinar that does a first-dive into
Kubewarden.

In this webinar, CNCF Ambassador Carlos Santana explores Kubewarden's
architecture, use cases, and benefits, with a smile in a
relaxed enviroment. You'll learn how Kubewarden policies can be applied at
admission control or runtime to ensure compliance and security.

[You can watch the full webinar here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46VGMAH_8jY).

Thanks Carlos!
