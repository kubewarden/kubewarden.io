As such they often have the need to log information. In general, we\nare used to make our programs log into standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) outputs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, policies run in a confined WebAssembly environment. For this mechanism to work as usual\nKubewarden would need to set up the runtime environment in a way that the policy can write to stdout\nand stderr file descriptors, and upon completion, Kubewarden can check them \u0026ndash; or stream log\nmessages as they pop up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven Kubewarden uses \u003ca href=\"https://wapc.io/\"\u003ewaPC\u003c/a\u003e for allowing intercommunication between the guest\n(the policy) and the host (Kubewarden \u0026ndash; the \u003ccode\u003epolicy-server\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003ekwctl\u003c/code\u003e if we are running policies\nmanually), we have extended our language SDK\u0026rsquo;s so that they can log messages by using waPC\ninternally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKubewarden has defined  a contract between policies (guests) and the host (Kubewarden) for\nperforming \u003ca href=\"https://docs.kubewarden.io/writing-policies/spec/02-settings.html\"\u003epolicy settings\nvalidation\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://docs.kubewarden.io/writing-policies/spec/03-validating-policies.html\"\u003epolicy\nvalidation\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://docs.kubewarden.io/writing-policies/spec/04-mutating-policies.html\"\u003epolicy\nmutation\u003c/a\u003e and now,\nlogging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe waPC interface used for logging is therefore a contract, because once you have built a policy,\nit should be possible to run it in future Kubewarden versions.

We have seen\nsome aspects of Kubewarden and the policy cycle:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow to write a policy from scratch\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow to test a policy with different requests\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, for your policy to be active on a Kubernetes cluster there\nare some bits and pieces we are still missing. The main questions at\nthis point are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow to safely make the policy easy to distribute\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKubewarden has focused on you reusing your existing knowledge\nand tools, so policies can either be distributed using an HTTPS\nserver, or preferrably, an OCI registry.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow to deploy the policy to a Kubernetes cluster\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe have created the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003ekubewarden-controller\u003c/code\u003e\nproject\u003c/a\u003e\nthat makes it trivial to deploy policies inside your cluster,\nonce the previous point has been covered.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHow can I connect the policy in Kubernetes? How can I establish what\ntype of requests will be evaluated by a policy?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also some open questions, such as: what happens if a\nresource that was accepted with a previous revision of a policy now\nwould be rejected with the latest policy version? In a living and\nevolving environment that holds state this is a common\nsituation. Kubewarden has also plans to have you covered in this case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will cover these topics in a much broader way in future blog\nposts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for reading up to this point, we hope you enjoyed the post!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen how to build a policy from scratch, in this case using Go\n(and the TinyGo compiler).
