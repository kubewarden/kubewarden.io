It is required that the programming language can generate the necessary WebAssembly module for use by Kubewarden.
When using a traditional programming language, the communication between the host executing the policy and the WebAssembly guest (the actual policy) uses the waPC communication protocol. This protocol provides a bidirectional channel between the host and guest.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.8.0 release</title><link>/blog/2023/10/kubewarden-1.8-release/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/10/kubewarden-1.8-release/</guid><description>Today we are happy to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.8.0! 🎉🥳
This is a small release, focused on OpenTelemetry.
The OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) got its first 1.0.0 version in July 2023; several libraries got their first 1.0.0 release, such as the Go metric SDK or the .NET Automatic Instrumentation.
Still, the OpenTelemetry stack is not yet stable, and unannounced backwards-incompatible changes still happen. You can have a look at the status of each of their libraries and protocols here.</description></item><item><title>Welcoming the Audit Scanner</title><link>/blog/2023/10/audit-scanner-feature/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/10/audit-scanner-feature/</guid><description>Fresh in the already released Kubewarden v1.7.0 stack, we welcome a new module: the Audit Scanner!
Audit Scanner? Up until the release of Audit Scanner, Kubewarden was strictly a Dynamic Admission Controller, checking requests made against the Kubernetes API server with the deployed policies.
Yet policies evolve over time; new ones are deployed, and existing ones are updated. This can mean that resources that are inside the cluster are no longer compliant.</description></item><item><title>kwctl SHA support</title><link>/blog/2023/09/kwctl-sha/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/09/kwctl-sha/</guid><description>Recently, we have focused on improving the Kubewarden developer experience. We have been implementing features requested by the community.
Reference policies by their SHA Since kwctl release v1.7.0 we support referencing policies by their SHA.
Container engines such as Docker and Podman allow users to refer to images by their SHA sum.
As Kubewarden policies are distributed as OCI artifacts, we thought it would be a good idea to add the SHA support to kwctl, so that users have a familiar experience.</description></item><item><title>Kubewarden 1.7.0 release</title><link>/blog/2023/09/kubewarden-1.7-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/09/kubewarden-1.7-release/</guid><description>Today we are delighted to announce the release of Kubewarden 1.7.0! 🎊 🥳 Aside from the bug and stability fixes, this release is packed with new features.

For that, you will need a private OCI registry accessible by your Kubernetes cluster. Kubewarden policies are WebAssembly modules; therefore they can be stored inside an OCI-compliant registry as OCI artifacts. For an air gap installation you need to download all the Kubewarden container images and policies in your workstation, then move them to your private OCI registry.</description></item><item><title>Keeping track of Kubernetes deprecated resources</title><link>/blog/2022/11/deprecation-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/11/deprecation-policy/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s fact of life: as the Kubernetes API evolves, it&amp;rsquo;s periodically reorganized or upgraded. This means some Kubernetes resources can be deprecated and later removed.
We deserve to easily keep track of those deprecations and removals. For that, we have just released the deprecated-api-versions policy.
A look at the deprecated-api-versions policy This policy detects the usage of Kubernetes resources that have been deprecated or removed from the Kubernetes API.
The policy has two settings:</description></item><item><title>Securing the usage of volumeMounts</title><link>/blog/2022/11/volumemounts-policy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/11/volumemounts-policy/</guid><description>We present to you the new volumeMounts Policy: It inspects containers, init containers, and ephemeral containers, and restricts their usage of volumes by checking the volume name being used in the containers' volumeMounts[*].name.
You can find it published in Artifact Hub. As usual, its artifact is signed with Sigstore in keyless mode, and if you are curious, you can peek into the policy&amp;rsquo;s implementation in Rust here.
This new policy joins the already existing volumes-psp policy, which provides an allowlist of volume types, and hostpaths-psp policy, with an allowlist of hostPath volumes.</description></item><item><title>Enforcing compliance of container's environment variables</title><link>/blog/2022/10/envvar-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/envvar-policy/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re glad to present the new environment-variable-policy to Kubewarden users. With this policy, you will now be able to inspect init containers and ephemeral containers. You can also restrict their usage by reviewing the names and values defined under the containers' env[*] field.
As always, the policy can be found in ArtifactHub and all the artifacts, including the BOM files, are signed with Sigstore.

In addition to the usual amount of small fixes, this release focused on the following themes.
Improve end users confidence We want our users to feel confident about using Kubewarden, knowing that good development and security practices are being followed by the Kubewarden project. We think this is particularly relevant to Kubewarden, given our users trust us to keep their Kubernetes clusters secure and compliant.</description></item><item><title>Scanning secrets in environment variables</title><link>/blog/2022/10/env-var-secrets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/env-var-secrets/</guid><description>We are thrilled to announce you can now scan your environment variables for secrets with the new env-variable-secrets-scanner-policy! This policy rejects a Pod or workload resources such as Deployments, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets , ReplicationControllers, Jobs, CronJobs etc. if a secret is found in the environment variable within a container, init container, or ephemeral container. Secrets that are leaked in plain text or in base64 encoded variables are detected.

Let&amp;rsquo;s see it in action! We want to verify the image ghcr.io/raulcabello/app-example which was built and signed inside a GitHub action using this GitHub Action.
Out of the box, GitHub Actions have a specially crafted environment that makes Sigstore keyless signing work in a non-interactive way.</description></item><item><title>Migrate your PSPs to Kubewarden policies!</title><link>/blog/2022/07/psp-migration-script/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/07/psp-migration-script/</guid><description>Warning: the code snippets shown inside of this blog post have become outdated. For up-to-date information checkout this section of the Kubewarden documentation.
As announced in past blog posts, Kubewarden has 100% coverage of the deprecated, and soon to be removed, Kubernetes PSPs. If everything goes as expected the PSPs will be removed in Kubernetes v1.25 due for release on 23rd August 2022.

With this in mind, the Kuberwarden team wrote a documentation to help users migrate away from PSPs to Kuberwarden policies.
As you know, the original Pod Security Policies had many configuration knobs. The Kubewarden team created a series of policies that offer a 100% feature parity with all the soon to be dropped Pod Security Policies.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the Monitor mode</title><link>/blog/2022/05/monitor-mode/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/05/monitor-mode/</guid><description>Policies are a core component of a Kubernetes cluster story that involves security, compliance and consistency.
Being this process an iterative one, it&amp;rsquo;s common for new policies to potentially reject operations that we might be issuing today in our production clusters.
As an example, we might have decided that it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to change certain annotations on existing resources after the fact. In this case, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to revoke UPDATE rights completely, but just to define an inalterable set of annotations after the resource has been created.</description></item><item><title>Secure Supply Chain with Kubewarden: securing Kubewarden policies</title><link>/blog/2022/04/securing-kubewarden-policies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/04/securing-kubewarden-policies/</guid><description>With recent releases, the Kubewarden stack supports verifying the integrity and authenticity of content using the Sigstore project.

The flaw in CRI-O allows bad actors to gain root access and run arbitrary code in the host machine.
A fix for the issue is already available and you should update your cluster to avoid any headache in the future. But if you cannot do that right away, use Kubewarden to mitigate the impact of this issue. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to prevent pods with sysctl configuration to run in the cluster with the policy sysctl-psp available in the Policy Hub.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the AdmissionPolicy</title><link>/blog/2022/03/admission-policy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/03/admission-policy/</guid><description>Up till now, the only way to define a policy in Kubewarden was to use the ClusterAdmissionPolicy resource that would be applied to cluster-wide resources across all namespaces.
That&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to announce the new AdmissionPolicy resource. This new resource is created inside a namespace and the policies will only process the requests that are targeting the namespace where the AdmissionPolicy is defined. Except from being a &amp;ldquo;namespaced&amp;rdquo; resource, AdmissionPolicy works exactly the same as the ClusterAdmissionPolicy.</description></item><item><title>Multiplatform Kubewarden</title><link>/blog/2022/02/multiplatform-kubewarden/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/02/multiplatform-kubewarden/</guid><description>The Kubewarden team is glad to announce that in the spirit of helping Policy Authors and Cluster Administrators, the project is now officially multiplatform.

As such they often have the need to log information. In general, we are used to make our programs log into standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr) outputs.
However, policies run in a confined WebAssembly environment. For this mechanism to work as usual Kubewarden would need to set up the runtime environment in a way that the policy can write to stdout and stderr file descriptors, and upon completion, Kubewarden can check them &amp;ndash; or stream log messages as they pop up.</description></item><item><title>A new architecture to ease Kubewarden administrators' lives</title><link>/blog/2021/10/new-architecture/new-architecture-to-ease-kubewarden-administrators-lives/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/10/new-architecture/new-architecture-to-ease-kubewarden-administrators-lives/</guid><description>We are pleased to announce a new architecture for the Kubewarden stack, in line with its journey to maturity:

These 2 changes are accompanied by a multitude of improvements to make Kubewarden more comfortable for Kubernetes Administrators, such as validation for Kuberwarden Custom Resources, improvements in Helm Charts, Status and Conditions for ClusterAdmissionPolicies.</description></item><item><title>Towards a universal policy platform</title><link>/blog/2021/09/towards-a-universal-policy-platform/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/09/towards-a-universal-policy-platform/</guid><description>Kubewarden is a policy framework for Kubernetes. It can be used to secure your clusters and to ensure they stay compliant with the rules your organization establishes over time.
By leveraging the power of WebAssembly, Kubewarden allows policy authors to write policies using traditional programming languages such as Rust, Go, AssemblyScript and Swift.
Kubewarden policies, once compiled into WebAssembly modules, are then distributed using regular OCI registries. This allows Operators to have a consistent way to securely distribute both container images and policies.</description></item><item><title>WebAssembly is coming to Cloud Native</title><link>/blog/2021/07/webassembly-is-coming-to-cloud-native/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/07/webassembly-is-coming-to-cloud-native/</guid><description>Is the title of this post a pun inspired by Christmas or by the Games of Thrones?

Is WebAssembly spreading inside of the Cloud Native ecosystem? 💯 I have no doubts about that!
First of all, why am I so excited about seeing WebAssembly flourish inside of the Cloud Native ecosystem? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of it.</description></item><item><title>Let's learn Kubewarden - Streaming Event</title><link>/blog/2021/07/learn-kubewarden-streaming-event/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/07/learn-kubewarden-streaming-event/</guid><description>In case you missed, CNCF Ambassador Saiyam Pathak recently hosted a live streaming event on his YouTube channel about Kubewarden. Flavio had the pleasure to join Saiyam and give an overview of the project.
We spoke about Kubernetes Admission Controllers, why we started the Kubewarden project and how it differentiates from other existing open source projects such as Open Policy Agent and Kyverno.
The talk features also a brief overview of WebAssembly, what it is and what are the benefits it provides to Kubewarden.</description></item><item><title>Introducing the PSP host namespaces policy</title><link>/blog/2021/06/introducing-the-psp-host-namespaces-policy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/06/introducing-the-psp-host-namespaces-policy/</guid><description>As you probably know, Kubernetes Pod Security Policies (PSPs) are being deprecated in Kubernetes 1.21 &amp;ndash; although these APIs will be served until Kubernetes 1.25 it&amp;rsquo;s a good time to start thinking about what you will use to replace them.
At Kubewarden we have an ongoing effort to replace the Pod Security Policies with small, targeted Kubewarden policies.
Up until now, we have implemented some policies that replace some Pod Security Policies:</description></item><item><title>Introducing kwctl to Kubernetes Administrators</title><link>/blog/2021/06/kwctl-intro-for-kubernetes-administrators/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/06/kwctl-intro-for-kubernetes-administrators/</guid><description>We are pleased to announce the availability of a new tool within the Kubewarden project: kwctl.
kwctl is a command line utility designed to help both policy authors and Kubernetes administrators.
This blog post focuses on the user experience of Kubernetes administrators. Future ones will cover the policy developer side of the story.
A Real-World Example: Controlling Container Capabilities The main character of today&amp;rsquo;s story is Alice. Alice is a Kubernetes administrator who wants to keep her Kubernetes cluster secure.</description></item><item><title>Writing your first policy with Kubewarden</title><link>/blog/2021/06/writing-your-first-policy-with-kubewarden/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/06/writing-your-first-policy-with-kubewarden/</guid><description>Kubewarden is a project focused on security and compliance. Its main goal is to allow you to write, test, distribute and run policies using the tooling that you already know and master, with a focus on controlling Kubernetes inner behaviors.
Policies are written in one of the supported languages, and the target object is a WebAssembly binary artifact. This is how Kubewarden can ensure that no matter where you built the policy, it can run on all platforms without any kind of adaptation.</description></item></channel></rss>
